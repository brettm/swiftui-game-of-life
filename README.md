# swiftui-game-of-life
A classic game of life simulation using SwiftUI canvas to draw the cells.

This is an experimental project. Of course it could be written using Metal and fragment shaders to simulate the cellular automaton for optimal perfomance but the purpose of the project is to play around with the canvas.
